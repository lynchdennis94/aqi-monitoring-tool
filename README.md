# aqi-monitoring-tool
A simle script to interface with PurpleAir, measure the AQI, and then trigger emails when critical events occur

The tool will take in data from the PurpleAir API interface, and based on configurable threshold parameters send an email if the AQI has crossed above or below the threshold.
